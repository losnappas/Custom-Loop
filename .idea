//html5looper thing start ----
problems:
	how to track what element was right clicked
			like doc.getElById(xx) or smtn
		and then track menu elements
	pure audio player problem:
		no place to right click with "audio" tag with just a controller bar
			bubbles? gotsta finds out.

USE SWITCH CASE INSTEAD OF IFS
//html5looper thing end ----

might be bugged if you only right click once or smtn?
	testing's gonna be a pain.


fix bug:
no endtime set-> doesn't always work.
	endtime===video endtime = gamble
possible fixes:
	ended listener
	setTimeOut
	

multi-checkpoint system.
	list? array? push/pop? points



contextMenus not supported on FF for Android -> does not work? untested . . .

//^^^^^^^^^^ thoughts v2.3 and before

swap to using 		media.addEventListener('timeupdate', ()=>{

literally made for this.


what happens in the code now:
	html5looper.js:
		timer runs in timer()


	advanced-menu.js:



class  for every creation?
	every media elemnt has its own 
		scrapped.
			doesn't make sense to create class objects. Every context menu click is a call with no info of previous calls




to test:
	attach setStart etc. to medialement prototype.
		then call like "element.setStart()"
			-> this.startTime=xxx
				where "this" is element context?
					could work?
						works but apparently bad practice
							dropped
								till custom elements?


use window.var instead of element attribs?
	benefits:
		no more hassling with array parsing
	cons:
		naming the variables.
			this isn't php...
				make a master var
					hang everything from that
						isn't that the convention?..
							gross.
